# Eat that Veggie Burger!

<b>Eat that Veggie Burger</b> is an app to "order" and/or "devour" veggie burgers stored in a database. This application is hosted on a Heroku server using Express and made using Node, JavaScript, MySQL, and Handlebars.

## <b>How To Use</b>

[Open the application.]()

Add a burger title on the left hand side. The burger will be added to the current list and you will now have the option to devour it. The devoured burger will then be added to the list on the right hand side for devoured burgers.

Unfortunately, as in real life, you can't "undevour" a burger after eating it. You'll have to add it to the list again to "devour" it again.
